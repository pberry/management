# Operations Manual/Leadership README for Patrick Berry

I was inspired to do this by [Katie Womersley](https://medium.com/@kawomersley/why-and-how-to-share-your-manager-readme-plus-heres-mine-8a4fe188ee1b). Other folks feel [very strongly](https://twitter.com/skamille/status/1065301721637896194) that documents like these are a massive self-congradulatory waste of time. You will, of course, have your own opinion.

## My Leadership Philosophy

I believe that smart people with the right information will not only make the right decisions, but they will effectively execute on those decisions. I believe that I shouldn't ask someone to do something that I wouldn't do myself. I believe that everybody should be treated decently and with respect. I believe that while I will be setting the high level goals, my most important role is to help you accomplish those goals.

## My answers to [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/ "What to ask in the first 1:1")

 ***

**What makes you grumpy?**

- Inflexibility and disingenuousness. Let me explain... We live and work in rapidly changing times that require the ability to adapt to change, but also realize that we don't just change for the sake of change. We're learning and then adapting. If we don't adapt based on our learnings then why did we bother learning? Disingenuousness is when you say you're good but you're really not and then you actively or passively try and derail attempts at progress. It's fine to not be good with something, but it has to be vocalized. 
- Also, any attack on my integrity or honesty will likely get a [disproportionate response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtrX9rZl-j4).

**How will I know when youâ€™re grumpy?**

- When I'm not playing poker, what I'm feeling is written on my face. I'm working on being more vocal about my state of mind, so know that I may not say it out loud.

**How can I help you when youâ€™re grumpy?**

- Most of the time I need a space to rant, gather my thoughts, and to gain perspective. Usually I like doing this with a nice adult beverage in hand.


**What medium do you like feedback in - chat, email, in person, etc?**

- As an extrovert, in person is preferable for almost all the things. That being said any format is welcome. I'm always on the lookout for ways to get better and I can't do that without your feedback.

**What routine do you like feedback in - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?**

- As it happens. The consensus on feedback is that it's most effective the sooner it's given.


**How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)**

- Public ðŸŽ‰ 


**What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?**

- I really strive to make these meetings the time that I can convey my hopes, desires, and challenges. I don't want to give status updates, that's what _status updates_ are for. I'm of the [Rands school of 1:1s](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/) and that this is the time I talk to _you_, *not* you telling me things.

**What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?**

- My top personal goal for this year is to find a mentor that will help me grow in this role. For the next three months it will be to rapidly ramp up my budgeting skills, my understanding of our current budget, and finally to dial in the forecast on expenses for the rest of the fiscal year.

**What do you need from your manager?**

- Feedback. Trust. Goals. Guidance.

**From your team?**

- I need every member of the team to be *on* the team and be committed to helping the team succeed at whatever the goal.

**From your peers? (outside the team)**

- I need you to give a damn. I need you to give a damn about the people, the department, the company, and the customer. Not always in that order.

**Whatâ€™s your favourite baked good?**

- Chocolate chip cookies, but alas Type I Diabetes has made baked goods a no-no.


## My expectations of folks who report to me

I need you to commit to what we're doing. If you're not sure what exactly it is we're doing, demand clarification. If you're still not on board I need to know why so we can resolve that. I need you to be an evangelist for what we're doing, especially when what we're doing is going to involve change.

I need you to understand the business. What makes us tick? What makes us successful? What are the pain points in other parts of the business? This will mean getting out of your area of expertise and out of your comfort zone. I need you to connect with other leaders in the business, especially people you're not already working with.

## What you can expect of me as your manager

I will listen. I won't be able to solve every problem that comes up, but I will always try. I will answer any question you have and if I can't, I'll do my best to get the answer.

I will be prompt in my replies. My replies to email will be slower than replies to chat. My replies to chat will be slower than my replies to texts. So, if you really need an immediate response, a text message is entirely appropriate.

I will be curious about your life outside of work and I will support you maintaining a healthy work/life balance. Life happens and I understand that. Life as an extrovert has given me the ability to be a bit of a social chameleon. You want to talk sports? I'm in. You want to talk fine wine? I'm in. If you want to talk about your favorite books. I'm in. I'm in because I'm interested in knowing what makes _you_ tick.

## My Influences

Perhaps the biggest influence in my managerial career is the book [Managing Humans](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1484221575/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=) by [Michael Lopp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellopp/). Recently [John Cutler](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler) and [David Marquet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqmdLcyES_Q) have been heavy influences on my thinking and actions. John asks fabulous questions that really make you think about what you're actually trying to accomplish and if what you're doing is really the best way to get that outcome. David focuses on leadership, specifically that by providing clarity to competent people, managers should be giving up control. If I had to pick just one "framework" to go with, it would be [Modern Agile](https://modernagile.org/) because it focuses on the people instead of complicated processes, workflows, and tools.
